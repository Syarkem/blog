title: glassic - a faster way to build webview apps
---

#### Scenario

You just finished an awesome webapp, it is live and responsive. You now want a webview client application. For Android. And iOS. Heck, throw in Linux, Mac and Windows in there as well.

#### Where does [glassic](https://mess110.github.io/glassic/) come in?

You don't want to build it yourself. And you don't have to. Here is a preview of what is [next](https://mess110.github.io/glassic/):

Lets build a mobile Reddit app. [Visit glassic](https://mess110.github.io/glassic/), select your platform and click build. Done.

Glassic can email you the build (desktop & android), but, if you want, you can [build it yourself](https://github.com/mess110/glassic).

- To run glassic you need node.js
- To build Android you need the android build tools.
- To build iOS you need a Mac

Feel free to ask questions on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/glassic), [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/mess110) or [github](https://github.com/mess110/glassic).

**Feedback greatly appreciated.**

#### Build it yourself

#### Future

I plan to automate the build process, so you get your .apk and .exe files easier than spelling *flabbergasted*.

Until then, you can find the [TODO here](https://github.com/mess110/glassic/blob/master/wiki/Home.md#todo), contributions welcome.

In the end, I will reference [Randall Munroe](https://xkcd.com/1205/):
