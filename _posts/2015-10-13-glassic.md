title: glassic - a faster way to build webview apps
---

#### Scenario

You just finished an awesome webapp, it is live and responsive. You now want a webview client application. For Android. And iOS. Heck, throw in Linux, Mac and Windows in there as well.

#### Where does [glassic](https://mess110.github.io/glassic/) come in?

You don't want to build it yourself. And you don't have to. And now, I don't have :smile:. Here is a preview of what is [next](https://mess110.github.io/glassic/):

You should replace **CoolBeans** with your app name and point it your website. Generate & download your applications, extract it and run *start.sh*

  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/1r8ci9q4zupt8w0w0a0tils96.js" id="asciicast-1r8ci9q4zupt8w0w0a0tils96" async></script>
</center>

Alternatively, follow the [instructions](https://github.com/mess110/glassic).

For further customizations, you probably want to build the applications yourself.

- To run glassic you need node.js
- To build Android you need the android build tools.
- To build iOS you need a Mac

I can also help with that. Please ask questions on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/glassic), [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/mess110) or [github](https://github.com/mess110/glassic).

**Suggestions greatly appreciated.**

#### Future

I plan to automate the build process, so you get your .apk and .exe files easier than spelling *flabbergasted*.

Until then, you can find the [TODO here](https://github.com/mess110/glassic/blob/master/wiki/Home.md#todo), contributions welcome.

In the end, I will reference [Randall Munroe](https://xkcd.com/1205/):
