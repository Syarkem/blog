29.07.2016 - almost didn't know the year. Currently in the airport, on my way
to Frankfurt, hope we make it in time. I need to buy my ticket for Windhoek,
Namibia. 16:04 met with Cheese at the airport.

18:01

@ the gate,
4-tee-eight
Kudu burger,
I will ate.

I just realized this might be the longest period of time which I don't touch a
terminal, since I first started using one. I saw the chineese basketball team.
They were doing exercises in the airport waiting area. All the girls were way
taller than me (1.87m). I wanted to take a picture but I wasn't allow to
disturb their training.
In the flight now, probably above Italy. I farted.

The eagle has landed. Without my baggage. No clothes, no sleeping bag, no nada.
I bought everything I needed from Windhoek, a city which looks like a german
town. The outskirts look like greek landscapes: small trees, a dry area. We
have enough beer and wine for the trip. I don't drink much wine.

Sunday 11:48 - today we are quad biking. Befere that, we stopped unde the shade
of a tree. Palm tree of some sort. It is really cold under the shade. Food is
on its way, munch is runching around. The sea is cold the sun is warm. We are
still drinking bear. Waiting for food. Ok food was good. Thomas won with the
jumbo burger. Kim jumped in the sea, lost his clothes to the waves, recovered
the clothes, lost one shoe for good. Word of the day: maybe more draft.

Quad biking time. Problem was the place was booked because we were late. Kim
might have had something to do with our timing. Instead, we went to Dune 7.
Quading was fun, the buff helped (TODO: mention buying the buff). We followed
a jackal and got some nice footage. Kasper ran down Dune 7 in a very GAAAAAY
(TODO: explain GAAAAAY) way. But I gotta give it to him, he went up the dune.
Good thing I didn't go up because there was an invisible cloud of sand. Fuck,
I can't write while driving (might have written drinking) on the gravel road.

(TODO: location) Local restaurant time. We ate a platter of seafood for 8
people. In my opinion it wasn't very fetsh but it had 2 amazing things:
fish file and the salad. The fish is called Kabel Jou.

Took the best shower. Warm. Next day, breakfast on the go in the parking lot.
I supplied on a knife, sandals and dried fruit. This is also where I got the
best buy of the trip, most value out of anything. A small camping cup. It
is the bush from here, my enemy.

Damn, in the car, I need sun cream. A... Much better.The unpaved road was
really beutiful but quite bad. 7 people in the car. We went on the road
for about 4-5 hours without a left or a right turn. We stopped at a sign
with 100km/h speed limit on the way to Brandberg Mountain. We will setup
camp in Damaraland, camp Mabisa. We stopped at a place where natives were
selling rocks. Didn't get one, given my predicament. The people selling
rocks had 2 kids and were living in a mini-box-hourse. Here. You can't see
much. Ornamental blown up tires on the side of the road. Flat, melted and dry.
You can see the ocasional Africa(TM) tree and ostrices. 3 or more, in
perspective they were about the size of the tire. Was strange seeing them
so close to the road.  Welcome to the wild, wild, west. (Retrospect: haven't
seen nothing yet).

TODO: location
Just like on TV, we saw black n' white (5000 years old) and color (2000
years old) markings. We saw a lot of elephant shit, the elephant rat,
Jimmy the lizard, and a trees destroyed by an elephants. A 35 year old
Damara dude was our guide on this hike. Bad front teeth but walks like a
gazelle.

Finally stopped at camp Mabisa. Tents are up, car is sort of clean, sausage
on the barbie: kudu meat. Quote from Teis: "that smells good". We have a
nice fire and a tab at the bar. This might not be a good idea, we will see.
Kasper quote of the day: "a handjob doesn't count". Woke up, had milk and
cereal. Water. The dried fruit added in the flakes were amazing. You know
what else is amazing? Waking up in this beutiful camp. Surrounded by rocks
and a dry river bed. We had a nice bbq area, toilets, shower and a
swimming pool.

TODO: elephant picture with priority
On the road you can see signs with "elephants have priority". I wonder if
elephants are called so because they are the opposite to ants. So what
does eleph mean?

There are all sorts of birds around. Glad I finally did this trip. Over one
year in planning and waiting. One down side of loosing your baggage which
I need to get used to. Not even sure how to describe it. Probably the worst
thing which came out of Australia: flip-flops.

Back to the camp. It is incredibly remote. The land here can not be owned.
(TODO: talk about chieftens and geography of namibia, split in 3 parts)
It can be leased. The land belongs to the bush. As it should be.

Rules aren't bad, the problem is how you decide who makes them. Now the
guys are philosophical. Currently talking about free choice. Books are
better than kindle, go with the flow. For the record, flip-flops are shit,
not enough people seem to agree with me.

10:45, not sure if local time, will take a nap regardless.

The steps of learning something:

1. Watch the process performed.
2. Watch each step of the process carefully.
3. Perform each step with the master, explaining each step.
4. Perform the entire process in full, with the mater supervising.

2016.08.01 / Teis

Now we are baking bread. No, scratch that, we are making a movie. (TODO explain movies.)
Bread is on the fire. "Cooking with Svend". Harderbeast and oricks stew/mash.
Add wine, milk mushrooms and any other goody you can find. Ate it with rice.
Was good.

The morning after, at 6:30 we shit like harderbeasts. Woke up before the alarm.
Arno and Chris arrived with the missing bags: Deans and mine. The funny
thing is that I might not need it. It was good to have it though. The flag will now
fly in Namibia. How was the trip? "It was too early and I am too drunk".
According to Dean: "getting the bag is extazy".

TODO: check spelling of Ruacana
Next morning, we pack our stuff, put it in the car and go. We are on our way
to Ruacana in northern Namibia. On the way there, we stopeed by the Damara
museum. It shows how people used to live in those lands. Problem is, they
are still living like that. Having someone to explain was nice. There were
little damara kids, women and 2 dudes. The smallest kid face was full of snot.
They showed us about their local medicine, the brewery, betting house, hunting
tranditional dances and we saw and touched 3 types of shit. They had a really
thick layer of skin on their feet. Sort of like cats. He was wiping his bear
feet on the ground, full of tiny rocks. Didn't seem like it bothered him.
They made a fiew with no modern tools in less than 3 minutes. Donkey shit was
involved. In their coulture, they are not allowed to own land or get married
if they can't start a living fire. Onwards to Ruacana. We went though 2 towns.
The towns were beaming with all sorts of characters. Herero ladies with their
weird clothes, drunk beggers. It seemed like the people weren't doing much.
Old men with funny hats, a woman dressed in bright colors speaking and making
a lot of hand gestures. We were at the gas station. People were swearming
everywhere but i t seemed like nothing was happening. Next town, we entered
a supermakret. Had plenty of stuff. Didn't find sliced cheese. Ice cream
was good. More Herero people. A lady had all of her $ in a plastic zip lock
bag. It seemed to contain the same type of coins. 15:00, just drove passed
Etosha. There are plenty more trees here. We have a nice cement road. Streight
road ahead. There were 2 police stops. They checked the drivers license and
circled the car. One of them pointed to our cooler.
TODO: talk about police.
You can see storks, cows, donkeys and goats. We saw a road sign: "roadhogs have
priority". One more police stop. After 17:00, so they just signaled us to
continue. No fences means we are in comunal lands.
