title: Hell(o) world!

is not the first program I wrote. I made sure to write some long joke within
the \<p\>, \<div\> or even \<body\> tag. I spent so much time on the joke,
it wasn't funny.

My goal is to code less and document the process. This blog will also contain
mindless ramblings and projects which I am working on.

TL;DR - You might find:

* games
* programming
* computer vision
* robotics
* cooking
* life stuff
