What do you get when you cross Bitcoin with 3D printing?

## A Bitcoin Paper wallet

Except it's plastic. They say you don't own the coin unless you own the private key.
Safer than paper, more insecure than steel.

This can be used to store your private key. Make sure you print enough letters. This wallet
can hold a maximum of 16 characters per line. 64 characters total. This means you can store:

* Private Key WIF (51 characters base58, starts with a '5')
* Private Key Hexadecimal Format (64 characters [0-9A-F])
* Private Key BIP38 Format (58 characters base58, starts with '6P')

You can view it in 3D [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2335490).

To test it out, I will hodl some Bitcoin here: **1FVjCBrdA2rKZKq6jyAZQQ12erZxHk9UXd**. Feel free to donate :)

## For the paranoid

This 3D print also includes a 1d16 hex die. By rolling it 64 times and writing down the
values, you are in fact generating a bitcoin private key (in hexadecimal format).

## Test prints

I am currently printing this on Yellow PLA with a layer height of 200.

The final print is 18cm x 10.4cm x 1.13cm. Once the print arrives, I will post
photos.

## Important

* If you loose coins because of this wallet, it is your fault, it provides
no guarantees
* This is an alternative to CryptoSteel
* I **DO NOT** recommend this over CryptoSteel
