Osu pronounced os is a way to show respect. Just like you would greet a friend with
hello, you greet your peers with os. You also greet your teacher and your classroom
with os. It can also be a way to say yes or ok.

Another form of comunication are stances.

Hachiji dachi is a relaxed stance. It is often used when awaiting instructions, a
form of relaxed standing. Arms should flow along your body, elbows slighly bent,
stand up straight but not super straight.

From Hachiji dachi we enter Yoi Dachi the basic/ready stance.

Perform a standing bow by switching to Musubi dachi, keep the knees straight, elbows
straight and relaxed, fists closed, hands slightly forward. Bend at the waist while
moving your palms to the side of your legs, fingers together. While bowing say os,
Unbend while moving your hands in the initial position. The bow takes about a
breath's length.

Switch back to Hachiji dachi.

This is your salute from now on.

At the beginning/end of the training greet your teacher and your peers.

Every time you enter/exit the classroom, greet it.

If you are late, wait at the entrance until the teacher aknowledges you.

As in any phisycal activity, warmup is important before every single training.
Never skip it.

*Never forget that karate begins and ends with respect.* Respect for others and
respect for the art. More importantly, it shows an attitude of humility that
means one is open to learn, and to receive new ways of thinking.
