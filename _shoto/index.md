*"One whose spirit and mental strength have been strengthened by sparring with a
never-say-die attitude should find no challenge too great to handle. One who has
undergone long years of physical pain and mental agony to learn one punch, one
kick, should be able to face any task, no matter how difficult, and carry it
through to the end. A person like this can truly be said to have learned karate."*

gaining knowledge which might seem counter-intuitive. *"There is no first attack in
karate."* This one really stood out. It seemed like a clear dissadvantage but it
actually sets the tone. Karate is about contradictions. You are training your mind
by exercising your body. You learn complexity by rehearsing simplicity. You learn
discipline and calm by phisical exercise.
